          AT APPROXIMATELY 15.33 IN LATE MARCH THREE RESIDENTS OF A CUL DE SAC IN
          MEMPHIS WERE APPROACHED BY A MAN OF, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, UNDISTINGUISHED
          DESCRIPTION. 'HE REMINDED ME OF AN UNWANTED RELATIVE' ....' A FACE FROM THE
          BACK OF A MILK CARTON' ... 'HE WAS UNMEMORABLE. A NASTY PIECE OF WORK.' THE
          VICTIMS CLAIM NO RECOLLECTION OF HIS WORDS OR THE FOLLOWING EVENTS, BUT ALL
          HAVE USED THE WORD 'POSSESSION' TO DESCRIBE THE EPISODES WHICH FOLLOWED 'I WAS
          OUT OF MY MIND' SAID THE FIRST VICTIM KNOWN AS AC. ALTHOUGH ALL 3 ACCOUNTS
          DIFFER IN THEIR QUALITY OF MANIC EPISODE, THEY EACH INDIVIDUALLY SPECIFIED 'HE
          MADE ME FEEL ALIVE'.
